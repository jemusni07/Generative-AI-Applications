Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the OCF Data Systems Lead position, referred to me by my friend Ian Gahinhin. With a Master’s degree in Data Science from Drexel University and extensive experience in data engineering and project management, I am eager to contribute to the Office of Children and Families' mission of enhancing community services through robust data systems.

In my recent role at VSoft Consulting and DXC Technology, I led initiatives that significantly improved data accuracy and operational efficiency. My projects often involved liaising with vendors and managing cross-functional teams to ensure high data integrity and compliance with business standards – skills that align well with the requirements of this role. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at OCF as it allows me to apply my technical and leadership skills towards impactful community work.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and making a positive impact on the lives of Philadelphia’s children and families.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Musni
